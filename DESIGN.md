In terms of designing my website YourSpace, I tried my best to focus on the ease of userability as well as the aesthetics of the website. Because the nature of the website is focused on mental health, I centered my website design around what would benefit individuals most when using the website during times of need. All buttons and texts are displayed and made to be easy to navigate. All of the visuals included in the website are intended to be aesthetically pleasing, and therefore relaxing. Much of my code focuses on the design of the elements on the website, as will be displayed in the explanations of my code below.

Background videos and photos (especially in 'safe spaces' and 'cuddly gallery'):
The main feature of YourSpace is the changing videos and photos that fill the background of the website. I utilized video and photo tags to include media into the body of the html code for each file. Video tags are followed with 'loop autoplay muted' to make sure the video will loop in the background without sound. I gave the videos and photos tags 'ids' to refer to them later in JavaScript. Using JavaScript, I refer back to the 'ids' of the videos and photos tags. The source of the media changes according to the buttons clicked. Hence, this allows for the video or photo of the backgorund to change on command. Furthermore, I utilized styles.css to stylize the videos or photos to fill the background of the webpage.

Horizontal menu bar:
The horizontal menu bar is accessible on all pages of the website. All the words on the menu bar are hyperlinked with the according webpage. styles.css was used to style the text of the menu bar, particularly to be in relative positions to the webpage.

homepage:
The homepage of YourSpace has a top horizontal menu bar and displays a video background of water splashing onto a beach shore. The text "Welcome to YourSpace. You are safe here." shows up in the center of the page. The homepage is usually the first page that an individual will see, so I made a page that welcomes the idividual into a "safe space".

safe spaces and cuddly gallery:
"Safe spaces" and "cuddly gallery" display the use of buttons and the eventListener function of JavaScript to allow for buttons to control the change of the background video/photo.

affirmations:
The affirmations page is an affirmations quote generator that relies on a list of strings and a random number generator to randomly generate the next quote to be displayed on the webpage. A quote is also generated each time a button is clicked, which the button also uses the eventListener function of JavaScript.

ysmedia folder:
The ysmedia folder holds all of the media (photos and videos) that were used in the project. All photos and videos were downloaded from pexels, so all media are royalty-free.
